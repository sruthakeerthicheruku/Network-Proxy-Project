# Network Proxy Project

This is a small network proxy I made in C++ to learn about **network programming** and **multithreading**. It forwards client requests to servers and sends back the responses.

## What It Does

- Forwards requests from clients to the server.  
- Handles multiple clients at the same time using threads.  
- Works with configurable ports and server addresses.  



## Requirements

- C++ compiler (C++11 or higher)  
- Works on Windows or Linux  
- Networking libraries (`<arpa/inet.h>` for Linux, standard Windows sockets on Windows)
